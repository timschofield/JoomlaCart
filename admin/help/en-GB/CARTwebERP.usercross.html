		<h2>CARTwebERP Extension</h2>
		<h3>User Cross</h3>
		<p>If you use CARTwebERP, please post a rating and a review it at the  
		<a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/bridges/e-commerce-bridges/8753" target="_blank">
			Joomla! Extensions Directory
		</a>.</p>
		<p>The user cross table stores the cross reference between Joomla users and webERP customers.  It is necessary
		to ensure the purchases by a Joomla user are always made against one webERP customer account.  Records in this table are
		automatically created when a user that is not logged in makes a purchase.  Data from the purchase is used to 
		create a customer record in webERP and a Joomla user record. The email address is used as the user name.  
		An email is sent with Joomla log in information on the first purchase.
		 </p>
		 <p>Use this menu selection to add more cross references or delete them.  If you have existing customers in webERP, you will
		 need to create a Joomla user record for them.  Use this program to create the Joomla to webERP cross reference record.
		 We recommend using email addresses for the Joomla User name for consistency with automatically created accounts.</p>
