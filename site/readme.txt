There is built in debug code that helps locate setup issues that can only be seen by admins.   In the options, company settings, set the debug parameter "on" under "Show Diagnostic Error information from sale" .  Log into the front side as an administrator and when you display the catalog, you will see more information with these errors.  The sql statements are given along with more in depth analysis.  The codes are my own design.  The C part of CM in the code stands for catalog.php and the M stands for the models directory.  The number that follows is the line number of that script.  I was tired of getting no information about the location and nature of sql errors.  When logged in as anything other than administrator, you should not see any error messages at all, assuming there is a connection to a database and assuming that parameters are not causing everything to be excluded.
